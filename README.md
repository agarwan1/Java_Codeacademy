Codeacademy Intro to Java exercises

Java is forced to use classes for everything. 
User class, user object.
Instances - for example. there can be different dogs with different names, different breeds, etc.
Java can be a slow start to learn. <br/> 
Java is used in the Back End, for hardware, not as much for desktop and web (but it is capable), Andriod and it is stable. 
**Java programs have at one class and one main() method.** 
Each class represents one real-world idea.
**main() method runs the tasks of the program.**
{scope of class & method} 
end of statement;
Compiled language - Compiling catches mistakes and transform code into executable class. 
It is a server side language - ex. the app venmo calculates new balance.
It was built in 1996 by Sun Microsystem.
**Java is STATIC TYPED - class based - rigid declaration of variable. For instance, the variable has to remain a string for its entire lifetime.** 
`public class CheeseCurls {  --this is the class declaration.
	public static void main(string[] args){   --Function
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}`

**public** - access specifier meaning we can access this from anywhere in that scope <br/>
**static** - access modifier meaning we can call this method directly using class name without creating an instance of that object <br/>
**void** - the return type (return nothing) <br/>
**main** - the actual method name <br/>
**String[] args** - main method accepts only strings as argument <br/>

**Is JS related?** <br/>
No! Only the name. Recently, JavaScript was updated to include classes. 
It was built in 1995 by Netscape. JS was originally called Mocha, then Livescript and finally JS. (Java inside Netscape due to Microsoft). 
**JS is DYNAMICALLY TYPED - don't have to specify types. Prototype based.**
`console.log("Hello");`
