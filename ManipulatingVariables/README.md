# Manipulating Variables
* add variables: `double updatedBalance = balance + depositAmount;`
* subtract variables: `double updatedBalance = balance - withdrawAmount;`
* multiply: `double paycheckAmount = 40 * 15.50;`
* divide: `double hoursWorked = balance / hourlyRate;`
* modulo - modulo operator %, gives us the remainder after two numbers are divided `int cookiesLeftover = 10 % 3;` (output is 1)
* Less than and greater than `System.out.print(amountToWithdraw < balance);` `boolean canBuyLaptop = myBalance > costOfBuyingNewLaptop;`
* equals: ==will tell us if two variables are equal. `System.out.print(paycheckAmount == calculatedPaycheck);`
* not equals: boolean balanceHasChanged = balance != updatedBalance;
* Greater/Less Than or Equal To: `System.out.println(paycheckAmount >= calculatedPaycheck);` 
* .equals: With objects, such as Strings, we can’t use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with Strings, we use a built-in method called .equals(). `System.out.println(person1.equals(person2));`
* String concatenation: System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);
